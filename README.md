#### Supermarket Data Analysis Project

## Overview

`Problem Statement`

Company XYZ owns a supermarket chain across the country. Each major branch located in 3 cities across the country recorded sales information for 3 months, to help the company understand sales trends and determine its growth, as the rise of supermarkets competition is seen.

`Objective`
Using the datasets for the three branches - Lagos, Abuja and PH, we would try to answer questions that would help us understand sales trends and determine how well the comapny is growing.
